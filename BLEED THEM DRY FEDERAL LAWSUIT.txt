Signature Block: Andrew J. Pigors, Pro Se
🔥 📑 NEWLY INTEGRATED NARRATIVE – FEDERAL COMPLAINT UPDATE (¶ XX – XX)
On July 14, 2025, while Plaintiff Andrew J. Pigors and his three-year-old son were camping in Charlevoix, Michigan, Plaintiff received real-time security camera alerts that unknown individuals were breaching his mobile home located at 1977 Whitehall Road, Lot 17, Muskegon, MI.

Plaintiff arrived to find his home partially destroyed—locks drilled out, doors pried open, and virtually all personal belongings, including his minor child’s possessions and appliances, scattered outside or damaged beyond recovery.

Despite immediate police presence and Plaintiff’s protests, no protective action was taken. A female agent on-site identified herself as Nicole Browley from “Homes of America”, though the eviction had been initiated under Shady Oaks Park MHP LLC, not Homes of America, and no court officer produced any documentation authorizing destruction or seizure of Plaintiff’s mobile home.

Plaintiff is the sole titleholder of the mobile home, which was not named, described, or included in the writ of eviction—which only concerned possession of the lot. No legal process authorized entry into, seizure of, or destruction of the home itself.

This act constitutes a willful deprivation of property without due process, a violation of clearly established rights, and a physical taking without compensation, in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and actionable under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985(3), and 1986, as well as MCL 600.2918, MCL 750.552, and the Fair Housing Act.

🧨 💰 DAMAGES CLAIM — TRIPLE-LAYERED EXPANSION
🟥 1. Compensatory Damages
✔️ Value of destroyed home and all property
✔️ Replacement cost for appliances, furnishings, child’s belongings
✔️ Out-of-pocket expenses for alternate housing, security, and repairs
✔️ Travel disruption, cost of urgent return from Charlevoix

Estimated Total (pre-discovery):
🔹 Mobile home (value): $18,000–$22,000
🔹 Household contents: $12,500
🔹 Emergency lodging + transport: $1,200
🔹 Total direct loss: $31,700–$35,700

🟧 2. Emotional Distress / Constitutional Harm
✔️ Child trauma (3 y/o present at time of destruction)
✔️ Psychological harm, emotional breakdown, security fear
✔️ Retaliatory eviction following protected activity and title ownership assertion

Legal basis:
– Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247 (1978) – constitutional damages for emotional harm
– Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299 (1986)
– MCL 600.2918(1)(b) – emotional distress damages

Claimed:
🔹 $150,000 (emotional + constitutional injury)

🟨 3. Punitive Damages (Intentional Misconduct)
✔️ Intentional deprivation of home and child’s security
✔️ Entities knew the writ did not cover the mobile home
✔️ Nicole Browley impersonated authority without legal basis
✔️ Police, HOA, and corporate actors coordinated or passively allowed it

Requested (per entity):
🔹 Shady Oaks Park MHP LLC: $250,000
🔹 Homes of America: $500,000
🔹 CT Corporation: $500,000 (for aiding multiple fronts)
🔹 Nicole Browley (individual capacity): $250,000
🔹 Muskegon PD/John Doe Officers: $250,000
🔹 Alden Global Capital: $1,000,000 (top-level orchestrator)

Total punitive damages requested: $2.75 million

📎 NEW SECTION ADDED – DECLARATORY RELIEF (FRCP 57)
A declaration is requested stating that:

Plaintiff holds lawful title to the mobile home

The writ of eviction did not—and could not—authorize removal or destruction of the mobile home

The actions taken on July 14, 2025, were void ab initio and violate federal and Michigan law

⚖️ LEGAL BASES EXPANDED:
42 U.S.C. § 1983 – due process deprivation under color of law

42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) – conspiracy between LLCs, agents, and court actors

42 U.S.C. § 1986 – failure to prevent deprivation despite knowledge

Fifth Amendment – taking of private property without just compensation

Fourteenth Amendment – destruction of property without hearing or notice

MCL 600.2918 – wrongful ouster; actionable per se

MCL 750.552 – criminal trespass during unauthorized entry

MCL 566.1 et seq. – fraudulent or unsigned lease contracts

Common law trespass to chattel / conversion
