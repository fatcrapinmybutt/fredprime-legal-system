================================================================================
Cycle 21/40: Comprehensive Judicial Bias and Suppression Map
Every hearing and ruling by Judge Kenneth Hoopes (14th Circuit) and Maria Ladas Hoopes (60th District) is now a discrete timeline entry:

Who presided, what was requested, outcome, Canon/procedural flaws.

Pattern: All substantive relief denied; only fee waivers and procedural accommodations granted.

Judicial “frivolous” labeling tracked as a suppression mechanism—weaponized for federal §1983 claim and JTC complaint.

Cycle 22/40: Service, Notice, and Proof-of-Service Weaponization
Defective/late/misdirected service is logged for every motion, order, and notice (including in-person, by sheriff, and by parties with no authority).

Service deficiencies cross-referenced to MCR 2.105/2.107 and used to challenge all orders/judgments.

Red flag: Service in person by officers/agents of non-party entities, and improper service during parenting time (Show Cause 3/4/5) weaponized for appeal, motion to void, and Canon complaint.

Cycle 23/40: Exhibit & Evidence Integration—Chain of Custody Audit
All uploaded files (pdf, docx, image, json, chat logs) indexed as exhibits, including:

Source, date, chain of custody, admissibility logic.

Each file linked to corresponding relief sought (e.g., binder, damages, timeline).

Photos and video of eviction, destroyed property, and entry attempts cross-linked with police logs and timeline—direct evidence for summary disposition.

Cycle 24/40: Corporate Veil Piercing and RICO Triggering
Each entity/LLC transition is now coded as a “veil-piercing event”:

Use of shells to avoid liability, confuse court, and evade tenant rights.

Coordinated pattern matches federal RICO predicates (fraud, extortion, theft of property).

Relief: All parent/successor entities to be named in all claims, damages, and asset recovery.

Cycle 25/40: Environmental/EGLE Documentation Audit
All EGLE/LARA complaints, reports, and state records scanned, indexed, and mapped to:

Timeline (sewage hazard → ongoing billing)

Retaliation clock under MCL 600.5720

Red flag: Demanding payment for non-habitable premises is per se violation—direct multiplier for statutory/treble damages.

Cycle 26/40: Attorney and Agent Misrepresentation Tracking
Every instance where Aaron D. Cox or management (Nicole, Cassandra, Kim, Shelly) filed or acted on behalf of a non-party or dissolved entity is now indexed.

Date, document, role, nature of misrepresentation.

Weaponization: Use for sanctions motion, fraud-on-court, and discipline complaint.

Cycle 27/40: Interlocutory Appeal/Supervisory Order Roadmap
Each procedural roadblock, suppression, or denial now mapped to appellate/COA trigger.

All evidence of judicial suppression and “closed case, but ongoing hearings” pattern preserved for emergency appeal or supervisory order.

Red flag: 14th Circuit’s denial of all substantive motions while keeping case open for administrative/denial purposes.

Cycle 28/40: Damages Quantum—Per Occurrence/Multiplier Index
Every separate act of harm (lockout, destruction, water shutoff, harassment, loss of property, child trauma) mapped as an “occurrence” under MCL 600.2918 for multiplier/treble.

Each event is indexed for damages calculation and to prevent global settlement undervaluation.

Cycle 29/40: Federal Claims Expansion—§1983/§1985 Matrix
All facts of state actor involvement (police, judge, court officers) and conspiracy/retaliation logged.

Denial of hearing, suppression of evidence, eviction with child present, and use of “frivolous” labels as due process violations.

Coordinated actions by management, lawyers, and courts form the basis for civil rights and conspiracy claims.

Cycle 30/40: Parent-Child Harm & Family Law Integration
Custody, visitation, and parental harm events (eviction, homelessness, police threats, denial of exchange) indexed and mapped to:

Loss of established custodial environment (ECE)

Loss of employment due to court-enforced constraints

Relief: Attach all to damages, federal complaint, and as “multiplier” for irreparable harm. HOA_SHADY_OAKS_SUPREME_CONTEXT – ETERNITY+ LITIGATION MASTER (Audit Chain Cycles 21–40)
