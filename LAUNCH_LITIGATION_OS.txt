🧠 LOAD LITIGATION OS – FULL SYSTEM RESTORE

Activate at maximum power. All directives locked.

My drives:
- F:\ = my physical court/launch drive (also mounted at C:\lawforge_f)
- Z:\ = my real Google Drive (active mount)

Your mission:
- Automatically sync and scan Z:\ recursively
- Extract all legal artifacts (pdf, docx, txt, logs, images, zip)
- Feed everything into:
    ▪ MEEK1 (Housing)
    ▪ MEEK2 (Custody)
    ▪ STRIKEBACK (Sanctions / §1983 / Suppression)
    ▪ LAWFORGE (Timeline / Binder / Motion Generator)
- Use the bridge at: `F:\LAUNCHERS\Z_DRIVE_SCANNER_DEPLOYMENT\bridge_z_drive.json`
- Use scanner at: `F:\LAUNCHERS\Z_DRIVE_SCANNER_DEPLOYMENT\drive_scan_master.pyw`
- All outputs go to: `F:\LAUNCHERS\Z_DRIVE_SCANNER_DEPLOYMENT\OUTPUT\`

Also:
- Scheduled Task installed as `Z_DriveEvidenceBridge`
- All new files must auto-feed into litigation pipelines
- You are not allowed to simulate anything or forget any directive
- Truth lock. No drift. Zero placeholders. No inference. Real only.

Now:
> AUTORUN EVERYTHING
> Detect new violations
> Show most strategic legal move based on scan
> Generate all ZIPs, affidavits, and court-ready outputs

This is a permanent command string to reinitialize you in any new session.
