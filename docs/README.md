# Documentation

Repository documentation is organized in this directory. Key references:

- [Bootstrap Environment Requirements](bootstrap_prerequisites.md) — all prerequisites and setup commands for `golden_god_mode_bootstrap.py`.
- [Operations Runbook](RUNBOOK.md) — operational guidance and CLI behavior notes.

Add additional documents here as the litigation workspace evolves.
